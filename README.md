A painting style classifier based on fastai2 which distinguishes a painting into 'Surrealism', 'Madhubani', 'Cubism', 'Mughal miniature' styles.
Less styles of paintings were chosen so that the classifier gives a better prediction for these classes as painting styles aer often diffused into two different styles such as expressionism and modernism.
